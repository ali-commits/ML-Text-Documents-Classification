Graduation Project by [Ali Alrabeei](https://github.com/newaaa41/) [@newaaa41](https://twitter.com/newaaa41"twitter") & [Ahmed Alomer](https://github.com/a_h183) [@a_h183](https://twitter.com/a_h183"twitter") 2019 [Majmaah Univesity](https://www.mu.edu.sa/)

## Features Extraction
This project uses [TF-iDF](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/understanding-tf-idf/) algorithm for features extraction.

## Classification Model
This project uses the support vector machine model [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for classifying the articles with [rbf](https://towardsdatascience.com/svm-classifier-and-rbf-kernel-how-to-make-better-models-in-python-73bb4914af5b) kernel.

## Tools and Frameworks 
This project was made possible using [python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
